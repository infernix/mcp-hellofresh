## How It Works

This connector uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) browser automation to interact with the HelloFresh website on your behalf. It launches a headless Chromium browser, logs in with your credentials, and navigates the site to perform the requested actions.

**Note**: This connector interacts with the HelloFresh website through browser automation. Website changes may affect functionality. Use responsibly and in accordance with HelloFresh's terms of service.

## Security

- Credentials are passed via environment variables only — never hardcoded
- The browser runs in headless mode with no persistent storage
- Sessions are not saved between server restarts
